# Overview:

In this repo, you'll find a PDF of the poster I made for my REU program at Tufts University from June-August 2023.

## Project Goal:

The goal of this project was to place constraints on corrections to general relativity using data from the Cassini Solar Conjunction Experiment. We considered a correction to GR that causes different polarizations of light to travel at different speeds, breaking the equivalence principle. 

## Collaborators:

I worked on this project with Rachel Nathan [Tufts University] under the guidance of Dr. Mark Hertzberg [Tufts University]. I am so grateful for their support throughout the summer.

## Notes:

This poster was first presented at the Leadership Alliance National Symposium in Connecticut in July 2023. It was also presented at the Tufts VERSE program poster session in August 2023.
